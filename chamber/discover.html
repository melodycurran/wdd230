                    The Stultz father/son dynamic guide duo found this goliath today on the lower Swan.  
                    Not only a two footer but thick as %*#$ too. Both Rod and Ryan guide here in Bigfork and we are happy to be able 
                    to work with these guys. Hell of a fish!
                    I was on the lower Clark Fork today and March browns poured off in the afternoon. 
                    The sun and wind didn't allow the anticipated greatness to happen but it was decent dry fly fishing with skwala 
                    foamies and Parachute mayfly patterns in the afternoon. It's supposed get breezy and warm over the weekend with highs in the  70's. 
                    The rivers will probably start back up soon.
                    Here is what NOAA thinks. Most of the freestones will probably do the same after the 70 degree weekend.

                When Joe Unterreiner became the Kalispell Chamber of Commerce president and chief executive officer in 1996, he thought he'd 
                only be there for a few years. But 24 years later, he's finally decided to transition into retirement starting this October.
                ‚ÄúIt's been a really great run ‚Ä¶ I really enjoyed the work, obviously, or I wouldn't have stayed this long,‚Äù Unterreiner said. 
                ‚ÄúIt's been a special environment to be able to work in.‚Äù
