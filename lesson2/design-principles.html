                I think Neil Patel's website is effectively utilizing the Visual Hierarchy principle of design.
                The headline which contains the hook is more prominent than any other elements in the site. Below 
                the headline is a few lines of paragraph that supports the headline. Then a big button with
                a nice contrast of white on dark orange. The site also uses spacing very well to group contents
                that are related. You can see how there are plenty of spaces between the headline group and the 
                text field and button. Lastly, on the far bottom, another statment that says swipe up which is has plenty of white spaces
                yet still noticeable because of the choice of color for the word "swipe up".
